# MATLAB PID Control (Reference)

Standalone PID control logic implemented in MATLAB.

## File
- `PID_control.m`

## Purpose
- Prototype basic PID tuning outside CARLA
- Compare response with Python version

## Features
- Simple simulation loop
- Plotting of response curve (optional)
- Easily extendable to test Ziegler-Nichols, overshoot control, etc.

## Notes
- For conceptual verification only
- Not connected to CARLA or any simulator
